    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This zucchini bread is really, really good and moist — my kids eat it as quickly as I can make it! This recipe makes two loaves but it freezes well and will keep in the refrigerator for weeks.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon or to taste</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded zucchini</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4-inch loaf pans.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, salt, baking powder, baking soda, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Beat eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla together in a separate large bowl with an electric mixer until combined; add flour mixture and beat well.</li>
        <li>Stir in shredded zucchini and chopped walnuts until well combined.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
